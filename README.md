This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Github Profile

In the project, I have used the asynchronous js to fetch the user details from the github 
open source api.

Clone this repository: `git clone` (https://github.com/nikzayn/Github-Profile.git)
Then `npm install`
And at last `npm start`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
